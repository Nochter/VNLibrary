---HOW TO USE:

There are 3 buttons:

---ADD:
Opens up a file explorer, allowing you to add files to the VN Library. The program is only designed to work with executable (.exe) and Shortcut (.lnk) files. Other file types will likely cause errors and not work. Files are sorted alphabetically, and you cannot add a duplicate file. It is recommended to use shortcut (.lnk) files because of how the program works.

---REMOVE:
Removes the selected file from the VN Library.

---READ:
Launches the selected file. The VN Library will automatically close after you do this. It is no longer needed, and it knows this.
